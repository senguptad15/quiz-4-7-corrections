Quiz 4:

Correct
Incorrect I got this question incorrect by selecting "Default values cannot be included in prompt statements." "let hours = prompt("Enter the number of hours worked this week.", 40);" accomplishes the goal of storing the user's response to the prompt in a variable.

Correct
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct by selecting only one of the two correct answers. I can now recognize that writing all the code in one line and not storing the document.getElementById in a variable can still display an output.

let z = Number(prompt("How many friends would you like to invite to the movies?"));
let x = Number(prompt("Please enter the number of your friends' parents who drive SUVs (capacity of 7 seats)."))
console.log("X parents who drive SUVs and Y parents who drive sedans are required to transport the Z friends to the movies.");

Partially Correct I got this question partially correct by selecting two of the three correct answers. I can now recognize that the if-else statements can be replaced by not only the two ternary operators that I selected but also "let status = (studentGrade < 88) ? "ND" : "HR";". This is simply the inverse of the two operators that I chose.
Correct
Incorrect I got this question incorrect by selecting the switch statement instead of the else-if statements. From this, I learned that else-if statements are more efficient and simple than that of a switch statement.
Correct
Correct
Correct
Incorrect I got this question incorrect because for loops are executed in the order setup, expression, loop body, update, and return to step 2. I switched around loop body and update, which was letter D for this question. I learned that loop body always comes before update in a for loop.
Correct
Incorrect I got this question incorrect by selecting the while loop that is formatted as follows: while(x<100) {x++}; This is obviously the incorrect answer because x is previously defined as greater than 100. The correct answer would be while(x>100){x--}; because this represents that a valid loop that will run at least once and will terminate.
Correct
Quiz 6:

Correct
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct because I answered that math.random, prompt, console.log, and alert can all accept return values. However, return values can only be accepted by prompts and math.random.

Correct
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct because I selected the second and final answer choices. The final answer choice was correct, however, the second answer choice was incorrect. The first answer choice was correct because it logs the function name and the parameters, not just the function name.
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct because I answered that math.random and prompt can both accept parameters. However, parameters can be accepted by prompts, alerts, and console.logs.
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct because I only selected the first and last answer choices. The second to last answer choice is also correct, however, because it simply stores the values x, y, z in a variable.
Correct
Partially Correct I got this question partially correct because I answered that: the name of the function is mystery, the function is not designed to return a value, and the function is not designed to accept any parameters. The correct answers were only that the name of the function is mystery and the function is not designed to accept any parameters. I can now recognize that the function is not designed to accept any parameters because there is not enough information to determine whether this is true.
Incorrect I got this question incorrect because I answered that the code snippet would only print 4 to the console. The correct answer, however, is that either 4 or undefined will be printed to the console. This is because if one or more of the parameters is not met, the code will not run as it is intended to.
