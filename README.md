Quiz 4:
1. Correct
2. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect by selecting "Default values cannot be included in prompt statements."
"let hours = prompt("Enter the number of hours worked this week.", 40);" accomplishes the goal of storing
the user's response to the prompt in a variable.
3. Correct
4. Correct
5. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct by selecting only one of the two correct answers. I can now recognize that
writing all the code in one line and not storing the document.getElementById in a variable can still display an
output.
6. Correct
7. Correct
8. Correct
9. Correct
10. Correct
11. Open Ended Questions:
    1. Correct
    2. Incorrect
      ```
      function carpool(){
      let z = Number(prompt("How many friends would you like to invite to the movies?"));
      let numSUVs = Number(prompt("Please enter the number of your friends' parents who drive SUVs (capacity of 7 seats)."))
      let x = z/7;
      let y = %x;
      console.log(x "parents who drive SUVs and " y "parents who drive sedans are required to transport the " z "friends to the movies.");
      }
      ```

3. Correct
4. Correct
5. Correct
6. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct by selecting two of the three correct answers. I can now recognize that the if-else statements can be replaced by not only the two ternary operators that I selected but also "let status = (studentGrade < 88) ? "ND" : "HR";". This is simply the inverse of the two operators that I chose.
7. Correct
8. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect by selecting the switch statement instead of the else-if statements. From this, I learned that else-if statements are more efficient and simple than that of a switch statement.
9. Correct
10. Correct
11. Correct
12. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect because for loops are executed in the order setup, expression, loop body, update, and return to step 2. I switched around loop body and update, which was letter D for this question. I learned that loop body always comes before update in a for loop.
13. Correct
14. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect by selecting the while loop that is formatted as follows: while(x<100)
{x++}; This is obviously the incorrect answer because x is previously defined as greater than 100. The correct answer would be while(x>100){x--}; because this represents that a valid loop that will run at least once and will terminate.
15. Correct

Quiz 6:
1. Correct
2. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct because I answered that math.random, prompt, console.log, and alert can all accept return values. However, return values can only be accepted by prompts and math.random.
3. Correct
4. Correct
5. Correct
6. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct because I selected the second and final answer choices. The final answer choice was correct, however, the second answer choice was incorrect. The first answer choice was correct because it logs the function name and the parameters, not just the function name.
7. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct because I answered that math.random and prompt can both accept parameters. However, parameters can be accepted by prompts, alerts, and console.logs.
8. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct because I only selected the first and last answer choices. The second to last answer choice is also correct, however, because it simply stores the values x, y, z in a variable.
9. Correct
10. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct because I answered that: the name of the function is mystery, the function is not designed to return a value, and the function is not designed to accept any parameters. The correct answers were only that the name of the function is mystery and the function is not designed to accept any parameters. I can now recognize that the function is not designed to accept any parameters because there is not enough information to determine whether this is true.
11. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect because I answered that the code snippet would only print 4 to the console. The correct answer, however, is that either 4 or undefined will be printed to the console. This is because if one or more of the parameters is not met, the code will not run as it is intended to.
12. Correct
13. Correct
14. Correct
15. Correct

Quiz 7:
1. Correct
2. Correct
3. Incorrect
The answer that I chose was incorrect because the .push built in function pushes an item to the back of an array. The correct answer was cars[3] = "Volkswagen"; because that would simply replace Honda with Volkswagen without changing the order of the items in the array.
4. Partially Correct
I got this questions partially correct because I only chose one of the three correct answers. I also chose one answer that was incorrect. After evaluating the correct answers that I did not choose, cars.indexOf(car) !== -1 and cars.lastIndexOf(car) !== -1 are both correct because both of these built in functions will search the array to check of the user drives a German made car. The incorrect answer I chose, cars[i] === car, will not search the array to check whether the user drives a German made car.
5. Correct
6. Correct
7. Correct
8. Correct
9. Partially Correct
I got this question partially correct by selecting one correct answer and one incorrect answer. The incorrect answer I chose is not correct because a console.log should only include the item that is being logged to the console. Logging the list along with the item will not achieve the goal of the function.
10. Correct
11. Correct
12. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect by choosing false instead of true. The function tripleDigits will return true instead of false because the numbers in the array provided all support the parameters provided.
13. Correct
14. Incorrect
I got this question incorrect because I chose the third choice instead of the fourth choice. The fourth choice is correct because getLargest will return all negative numbers, which is not the goal of the function.
15. Correct
